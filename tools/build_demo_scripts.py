"""Generate per-persona demo scripts as a Word document.

Six self-contained scripts, one per persona, each a page or two so a single
script can be handed to whoever is presenting to that audience. They are
deliberately NOT one template with the role name swapped: each persona opens on a
different page, drives different figures and closes on a different point, because
that is the only way the demo lands as being about their job.

Figures come from /tmp/persona_facts.json, queried from the running application.
