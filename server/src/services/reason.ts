/**

 * Why COMPLETE and not Cortex Analyst
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Analyst answers questions about data that exists in tables. A scenario is a
 * hypothetical the engine has just computed in memory — the ripple, the reroutes
 * and the residual exposure are nowhere in Snowflake to be queried. Analyst would
 * dutifully query the undisrupted network and answer the wrong question.
 *
 * So the computed scenario is passed to AI_COMPLETE as facts, and
 * the model is asked to interpret rather than to calculate. Every number in the
 * prompt comes from the deterministic engine; the model contributes judgement,
 * ranking and prose. That split is deliberate and worth preserving: if the model
 * were asked to do arithmetic the figures would stop being auditable.

Brief the director in four short sections, using these exact labels:

WHAT HAPPENS — the ripple in plain language, naming the nodes and why the impact
reaches them. Make clear which effects are immediate and which are deferred by
inventory.

WHAT IT COSTS — the exposure, and which single line item matters most.

WHAT TO DO NOW — the reroutes, in priority order, and what each one costs in
capacity. Flag any plant left with no room.

WHAT IS STILL EXPOSED — the residual risk and the specific action it needs.

QUESTION: ${question}

Answer only this question, grounded in the figures above. If the question asks
about a change the simulation has not modelled — a different plant, a longer
outage, extra capacity — reason from the numbers given and say explicitly which
part is inference rather than simulated output. If answering properly would need
a re-run with different inputs, say which inputs to change.`;
